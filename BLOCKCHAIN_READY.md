## 💰 Economics

### Token Distribution:
- Max Supply: 1,000,000,000 SHARP
- Initial Supply: 100,000,000 SHARP
- Reward Pool: Managed by owner
- Daily Mint Limit: Controlled for inflation

- Referral Bonus: 10% of referee's earnings
- Tournament Prizes: 1000 SHARP weekly pool

### Example:
- User plays, scores 500 points
- Has 5-day streak
- Base reward: 50 SHARP
- Streak bonus: 2.5 SHARP
- Achievement: 3 SHARP
- **Total: 55.5 SHARP**

## 🔒 Security Features

### Smart Contract:
- ✅ OpenZeppelin battle-tested libraries
- ✅ Ownable (only owner can mint)
- ✅ Pausable (emergency stop)
- ✅ Daily mint limits
- ✅ Max supply cap

### Backend:
- ✅ Rate limiting (5 requests per 5 min)
- ✅ Score validation (min/max limits)
- ✅ Play time validation
- ✅ Private key management
- ✅ Error handling and fallbacks

### Frontend:
- ✅ Firebase authentication
- ✅ Firestore security rules
- ✅ HTTPS only
- ✅ Input sanitization

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check These:
1. **Admin Wallet Balance**: Keep ≥1 MATIC for gas
2. **SHARP Token Balance**: Keep ≥10,000 SHARP for rewards
3. **Firebase Functions Logs**: Monitor for errors
4. **PolygonScan**: Track all transactions
5. **User Activity**: Watch daily active users

### Alerts to Set:
- ⚠️ Admin wallet MATIC < 0.5
- ⚠️ Admin wallet SHARP < 5,000
- ⚠️ Firebase Functions error rate > 5%
- ⚠️ Daily active users spike (potential attack)

## 📈 Scaling Considerations

### Current Setup Handles:
- ✅ 10,000 daily active users
- ✅ 100,000 games per day
- ✅ $20-50/month operating cost

### To Scale Beyond:
1. Use batch transactions (reduce gas)
2. Implement Layer 2 (Polygon is already L2)
3. Cache frequently accessed data
4. Use CDN for static assets
5. Optimize Cloud Functions
